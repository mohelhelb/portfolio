## Blog Application

Simple blog-based application built with Flask (Python web framework)


### Description
It allows users to register for a new account,
sign in, sign out, and cancel their accounts. It is also CRUD
compliant, that is to say it is a model that provides four basic
types of functionality: *Create*, *Read*, *Update*, and *Delete* posts.
Despite the fact that it is not a large application, *user authentication* and
*user experience* have been carefully taken into account.
